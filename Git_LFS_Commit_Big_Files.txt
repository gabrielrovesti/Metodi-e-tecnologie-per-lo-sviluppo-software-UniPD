Step 1: Download and Install Git-lfs ( Git Large File Storage ) from here.
Step 2: Setup Git lfs for your user account git lfs install.
Step 3: If you have already tried to commit large files and got the error then you must first undo the commit, use git reset — soft HEAD~1 otherwise ignore this step.
Step 4: Select the file types that you want Git-lfs to manage using the command git lfs track “*.csv” , this creates a .gitattributes file.
Step 5: Add the .gitattributes file along with other files which need to be committed and push the changes.

git add .gitattributes TrainAndValid.csv
git commit -m "Adding Train and Validation set"
git push origin master
And it pushed without any errors :)
